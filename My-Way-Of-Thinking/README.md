# Presentation of "MY-WAY-OF-THINKING"

## Overview
This repository is designed to demonstrate my problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and approach to challenges in data science, artificial intelligence, and mathematics. It contains multiple short exercises and real-world problems. Each exercise is accompanied by explanations of my reasoning, implementation choices, and potential improvements

## Purpose
- Showcase my **logical thinking** and methodology when approaching problems
- Provide a clear and organized structure for others to **follow my thought process**.
- Improve my **portfolio** for technical interviews
